How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Much easy! Really wow!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Better programmer! Much win!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More work

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because there is no correlation between the files!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    In the terminal!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can just undo any shit that I did!
    
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To keep my sanity
