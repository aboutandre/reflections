    What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

All the files in the repository will be added. I need it to start commiting and adding further files.

    How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is like putting stuff in a box without shipping the box. You can put and take stuff from it and when you're ready you send the box away!
