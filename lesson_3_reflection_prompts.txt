When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To work with other people or maybe to have access from different computers (eg: Home and Work)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it could lead to errors. How will Github know how to merge the files?
