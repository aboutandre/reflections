When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To work with other people or maybe to have access from different computers (eg: Home and Work)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because it could lead to errors. How will Github know how to merge the files?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a feature available only in Github. It works like a clone, but only in their servers.
A clone is exactly what it says. It makes a perfect copy of a repository, so that you can work on it.
A branch is a division of a repository where you can work on different features without messing with the master branch.
